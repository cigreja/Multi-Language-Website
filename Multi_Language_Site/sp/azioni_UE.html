        <article>
            <p><font class="">European Union Law (or Community law, as the term that was used prior to the Lisbon Treaty which entered into force on 1 December 2009) is applicable to all natural and legal persons, even those who live / work exclusively within their  national borders.</p>

            <p>Indeed, EU Law not only applies to international relations (intra and extra EU), but also has an influence on many branches of law (either by direct applicability or because the law of a Member State must conform to it).</p>

            <p>Community law may be invoked by all those who have an interest, through multiple avenues and jurisdictions.</p>

            <h3>BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURTS</h3>
            <div class="more">
                <span style="cursor: pointer; font-style: italic;">plus »»»</span>

                <div class="extra-info">
                    <p>Since EU law is applicable in the Member States, any dispute about the interpretation or validity must be raised before the national courts, competent according to the internal rules of procedure of each Member State.</p>

                    <p>Compete, in fact, the national courts to apply Community law and if they have doubts about its interpretation or its validity for help to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, through the preliminary ruling.</p>

                    <p>The referral to the European Court is also required (and not just possible) to the national courts of last resort, as the Court of Cassation and the State Council.</p>

              <h3>REFERENCE TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE BY THE NATIONAL COURT</h3>
            <div class="more">

                <div class="extra-info">
                    <p>The responsibility to apply Community law and to enforce it, if necessary in cooperation with the Court of Justice of the European Union based in Luxembourg, rests in first instance on the national courts.</p>

                    <p>In fact, the national court called to decide on a matter (civil, criminal, administrative or tax) whose outcome depends on a EU rule- can or should (as appropriate) suspend the process to refer to the Court of Justice a preliminary question on the correct interpretation or validity of that rule (in accordance with art. 267 TFEU Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union)</p>

                    <p>The reference to the Court of Justice is a very important instrument of cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, as it provides to the former - for example - an interpretation of EU law needed to resolve disputes before those courts (in cases - for instance - where both parties have relied on Community law, but interpreting it in different ways, or where one party has invoked Community law and the other national law).</p>
                    
                     <p>Although the reference ruling can only be initiated by decision of the national judge in the case, it is often highly advisable that one or the parties to the case urge the activation of this instrument.</p>
                     
                      <p>During such a procedure, the parties to the national case have the right to submit comments to the Court of Justice. Thus, they have the opportunity to play an active role to try to induce the European Court to provide an interpretation (or a judgment on the validity) of Community rules favorable to their thesis.</p>
                      
                       <p>Therefore, this is a tool that may prove decisive for the protection of clients of the Firm.</p>

                    <p>The partners of the Firm have considerable experience with these procedures -- having appeared in almost seventy (to date - March 2015) proceedings before the Tribunal and the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg.</p>

                    <p>These procedures have focused, for example, the following matters:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>antitrust (against sanctions imposed by the European Commission for participation in cartels and agreements deemed anti-competitive);</li>
                        <li>State aid (granted to companies and declared incompatible with EU rules by the European Commission);
                        </li>
                        <li>tax law (taxes on the raising of capital in relation to the registration provided for by Italian law);
                        </li>
                        <li>customs (tariff classification of goods imported from non-EU countries);
                        </li>
                        <li>imports of agricultural products from third countries (in relation to the licensing system laid down by European law for certain sectors (e,g. fruit and vegetables);
                        </li>
                        <li>European agricultural law (premiums and funds provided by the various industry regulations);
                        </li>
                        <li>European fisheries law (against prohibitions of use of certain fishing methods);
                        </li>
                        <li>environment (with regard to the protection against various forms of pollution);
                        </li>
                        <li>rights of the Members of the European Parliament (MEP) (assistance to MEPs in relation to their pension scheme and social security);
                        </li>
                        <li>administrative transparency of the EU institutions (against denial - total or partial - of access to documents);

            <h3>Complaints to the European Commission against companies or Member States</h3>
            <div class="more">
                <span style="cursor: pointer; font-style: italic;">plus »»»</span>

                <div class="extra-info">
                    <p>The firm also regularly prepares, files and represents complaints  to the European Commission reports in various sectors.</p>

                    <p>A complaint - it is good to highlight - does not obviate the need, if any (also in order to avoid prescriptions or forfeitures), to bring forth a planned legal action at national level; however, it can be a "strategic"  tool for the purpose of better protection of clients of the Firm.</p>

                    <p>In fact, a complaint can - if it appears well-founded - lead the Commission to pressure (if necessary, through the opening of formal "infringement proceedings" pursuant to art. 258 TFEU) the competent national authorities (central or local ) to amend the legislation or internal administrative practices considered contrary to the Community legislation or jurisprudence.</p>

                    <p>A complaint may also be directed to the case law of national courts (especially to that of the higher courts) if contrary to European law.</p>

                    <p>Complaints in competition matters (antitrust and State aid) are subject to special rules in terms of procedure and may lead, if they are deemed well-founded, to decisions of the European Commission to sanction or impose fines against the companies complained of.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of the industry, the complaint - sometimes - allows you to deposit as part of a national cause any pending notices - if favorable - that the European Commission shall provide the entity complainant.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, this is a tool that may prove decisive for the protection of clients of the firm.</p>


                    <p>By way of example, and limited to the past five years, the Firm has filed complaints:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>against German companies suspected of breaking the rules of European competition law (Art. 101 and 102 TFEU);
                        </li>
                        <li>against Italy for having planned and implemented fiscal measures to be considered State aid incompatible with the European rules (Arts. 107 and 108 TFEU);
                        </li>
                        <li>against Italy for violation by the local customs authorities, of the Community legislation on the rights to health inspection;
                        </li>
                        <li>against Italy for violation by the local customs authorities, of Community rules on imports of Chinese garlic;
                        </li>
                        <li>against Italy for violation by the Italian Supreme Court of the right to deduct VAT established by the European Court of Justice;
                        </li>
                        <li>against Poland for violation by the regional authorities, of the European legislation on the environment and the principles of freedom of establishment and provision of services, having refused - it is believed for discriminatory reasons based on nationality - to a Polish company with Italian capital the authorization to operate a waste disposal plant in Poland.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Complaints to the European Ombudsman against maladministration</h3>

            <div class="more">
                <span style="cursor: pointer; font-style: italic;">plus »»»</span>

                <div class="extra-info">
                    <p>Finally, the Firm prepares, introduces and represents complaints to the European Ombudsman (in accordance with art. 228 TFEU) who investigates complaints about maladministration involving institutions and bodies of the European Union.</p>

                    <p>Who can complain to the European Ombudsman?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>nationals of a Member State of the European Union and persons residing in a Member State;
                        </li>
                        <li>businesses, associations and other entities that are established in the European Union.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As with other types of complaints, a complaint to the European Ombudsman - it is well to stress - does not obviate the necessity to initiate possible legal actions before the Tribunal of the European Union.</p>

                    <p>However, sometimes, it can be a useful alternative to other legal proceedings, as the European Ombudsman may decide to encourage amicable solutions that satisfy both the complainant and the institution.</p>

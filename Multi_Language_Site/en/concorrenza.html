                        <h4>Cases</h4>
                        <p>
                            To give an idea of ​​the type of cases represented by the Firm before the Tribunal and the Court of Justice of the European Union, we list the following "direct" procedures:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>action for the annulment of a decision of the European Commission who deemed illegal sSate aid granted by Greece to companies active in the cement industry;  </li>
                            <li>actions to challenge the decision by the European Commission to declare illegal some regional aid provided to reduce the environmental impact of steel plants; </li>
                            <li>actions to oppose fines imposed by the European Commission for anti-competitive agreements in the steel sector;</li>
                  
                  
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Firm also regularly prepares and introduces complaints before the European Commission:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>against other companies suspected of breaking the rules of European competition law (Articles 101 and 102 TFEU); </li>
                            <li>against Member States suspected of having planned and / or implemented State aid incompatible with the European rules (Articles 107 and 108 TFEU).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        
                        <p>For example, the firm has filed complaints: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>against German companies that had de facto imposed in the photovoltaic sector, contracts for the supply of silicon wafers containing clauses which were overly restrictive of competition or otherwise an abuse of their dominant position;</li>
                            <li>against Italy for having established an unfair and discriminatory system of financing the activity of its Competition Authority.</li>
                        </ul>
